# voidfetch
a WIP neofetch alternative made by a very new programmer in Python

# Why?
heres why explained in 3 words: neofetch was discontinued

# notes:
this is VERY wip, expect bugs, glitches, and imperfections.

as of october 15th, 2024, there is no ascii art in the terminal when you run the file, and theres no command to actually run it without running the python file

if you dont understand what the license for this means then in simple terms: you can do basically anything you want with voidfetch, this includes use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and sell voidfetch
