# voidfetch
a WIP neofetch alternative made by a very new programmer in Python

# Why?
heres why explained in 3 words: neofetch was discontinued

# notes:
this is VERY wip, expect bugs, glitches, and imperfections.

as of october 15th, 2024, there is no ascii art in the terminal when you run the file, and theres no command to actually run it without running the python file
